# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
- The purpose of the new analysis is well defined

## Results
- There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables

## Summary
- The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight
