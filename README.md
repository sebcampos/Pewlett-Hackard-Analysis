# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The goal for this analysis  was to utilize the tools PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to determine the number of retiring employees per title, create a csv file from this table, identify employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program then create a csv file for this table as well.
## Results
### Number of Retiring Employees by Title

### Percentage of Employees Retiring by Title
![alt text](https://github.com/sebcampos/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/master/resources/percentage_retiring.png?raw=True)
- There are a total of 90,398 retiring employees of our total 300,024 - roughly 30 percent of our employees.
 
- The largest amount of retirements seem to be coming from the Senior Engineers and the Senior Staff members
 
 
- We can see that there are 2 managers who are retiring. Some departments only contain 2 managers. We need to check if these two managers are working for the same department and if so, make the necessary changes so as to not leave a department without a manager.
### Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program

- There are a total of 1,549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship, of these employees 271 are Senior Engineers and 428 are Senior Staff members. These two titles are where we are losing the most employees so we will want to incentivise these potential members become mentors and help us make up for these losses.
## Summary
- The number of retiring employees is 90,398
- The number of eligible employees for mentorship is 1,549
 - We should also note that there are no manager titles available for the mentorship program and we are losing 20% of our managers. We might have trouble finding new managers.
 
- We can also see below that the two managers retiring are only leaving one manager to their department to manage an enormous amount of people. We might want to hire new managers here as asp

- There are a total of 1,940 employees who are eligible for the mentorship, of these employees 357 that are also Senior Engineers. Because we are losing more than 90% of our senior engineers it would be reasonable to pursue these mentors to help us close the large loss of senior engineers
 
 
## Summary
- The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight
 
- The number of retiring employees is 90,398
 
- the number of eligible employees for mentorship is 1,940
